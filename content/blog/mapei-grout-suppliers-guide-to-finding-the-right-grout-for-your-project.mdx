# A Mapei Grout Supplier's Guide to Finding the Right Grout for Your Project

Choosing the right grout is as important as selecting the perfect tiles. Grout isn't just about looks; it binds tiles together, prevents moisture seepage, and protects surfaces from damage. This comprehensive guide helps you navigate Mapei's grout options to find the perfect match for your project.

## Why Grout Matters

The space between tiles may seem insignificant, but grout performs several critical functions:

- **Structural Support**: Holds tiles in place and distributes stress
- **Water Protection**: Prevents moisture from reaching substrates
- **Aesthetic Completion**: Provides the finishing touch that defines tile work
- **Hygiene**: Properly sealed grout resists bacterial growth

Choosing the wrong grout leads to premature failure, staining, and costly repairs.

## Five Types of Mapei Grout

### 1. Sanded Grout
Best for wider joints over 1/8 inch (3mm). The sand aggregate provides strength and reduces shrinkage in larger gaps.

**Ideal Applications:**
- Floor tiles
- Large format tiles with wide spacing
- Outdoor installations
- High-traffic areas

### 2. Unsanded Grout
Designed for narrow joints under 1/8 inch. The smooth texture prevents scratching on delicate surfaces.

**Ideal Applications:**
- Wall tiles with tight joints
- Glass and polished tiles
- Marble and sensitive natural stone
- Mosaic installations

### 3. Epoxy Grout
Chemical-resistant and waterproof, epoxy grout handles the toughest environments.

**Ideal Applications:**
- Industrial kitchens and food service
- Swimming pools and fountains
- Laboratory floors
- High-hygiene medical facilities

### 4. Ultracolor Plus FA
Fast-setting grout with advanced technology for professional results.

**Ideal Applications:**
- Rapid turnaround projects
- Residential bathrooms and kitchens
- Commercial installations
- Projects requiring quick return to service

### 5. Premixed Grout
Ready-to-use convenience without mixing required.

**Ideal Applications:**
- Small repair projects
- DIY installations
- Touch-up work
- Limited quantity needs

## Selection Criteria

### Tile Type
Different tiles require different grout types:
- Porous natural stone: Unsanded or premixed to prevent scratching
- Porcelain and ceramic: Any type based on joint width
- Glass mosaics: Unsanded or epoxy for clarity
- Textured tiles: Consider cleaning difficulty

### Joint Width
Match grout type to joint dimensions:
- Under 3mm: Unsanded grout
- 3mm to 12mm: Sanded grout
- Over 12mm: Wide-joint grout formulas
- Variable widths: Consider multiple products

### Location
Environmental exposure determines grout requirements:
- Wet areas: Waterproof or water-resistant options
- Outdoor: Flexible formulas for movement
- High traffic: Durable, stain-resistant products
- Food service: Easy-clean, hygienic grouts

### Aesthetics
Color and finish affect overall appearance:
- Match grout to tile for seamless look
- Contrast grout highlights tile patterns
- Consider stain visibility in color selection
- Evaluate maintenance requirements

### Application Ease
Consider installer skill level:
- Premixed for simplicity
- Standard grouts for experienced installers
- Epoxy requires specific techniques
- Fast-setting needs quick application
