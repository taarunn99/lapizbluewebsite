# Is Your Shower Grout Changing Colour? How Mapei Tile Grout Can Help

Few things diminish a bathroom's appearance faster than discolored grout. Those once-pristine white lines between tiles can gradually transform into dingy, stained eyesores. Understanding why this happens and how Mapei tile grout prevents it helps you maintain a beautiful, hygienic bathroom.

## Why Shower Grout Changes Color

### 1. Moisture and Mold Growth
Showers create perfect conditions for mold development. High humidity and constant water exposure allow mold spores to colonize poorly sealed grout, creating unsightly black or green discoloration.

### 2. Soap Scum Buildup
Residues from shampoo, body wash, and soap accumulate on grout surfaces over time. These deposits create yellowish or grayish layers that dull grout appearance.

### 3. Hard Water Stains
Mineral deposits from calcium and magnesium in tap water leave white, crusty buildups or yellowish stains on grout lines.

### 4. Improper Cleaning
Ironically, harsh cleaning chemicals can damage grout. Bleach and acidic cleaners erode grout surfaces and remove protective sealants, making discoloration worse over time.

### 5. Poor-Quality Grout
Unsealed or low-grade grout materials absorb contaminants rapidly. Without protective properties, standard grout becomes stained quickly.

## How Mapei Grout Solves These Problems

### Stain-Resistant Technology
Mapei's advanced formulations incorporate stain-resistant polymers that prevent contaminants from penetrating grout surfaces.

### Water-Repellent Formulations
DropEffect technology in Mapei Ultracolor Plus causes water to bead on the surface rather than absorbing into the grout.

### Color Variety
With over 30 color options, you can choose grout colors that complement your tiles and hide minor discoloration.

### Easy Maintenance
Mapei grout's smooth, non-porous surface simplifies cleaning and resists buildup.

### Pre-Mixed Sealants
Many Mapei grouts include integrated sealing properties, eliminating the need for separate sealer application.

### BioBlock Technology
Antimicrobial properties in Mapei grouts inhibit mold and mildew growth, preventing biological discoloration.

## Restoring Discolored Grout

If your existing grout has already changed color, follow these restoration steps:

### Deep Cleaning
Use pH-neutral cleaners designed for grout. Avoid bleach and acidic products that cause further damage.

### Damage Assessment
Examine grout for cracks, missing sections, or severe deterioration that requires replacement rather than cleaning.

### Sealing Application
After cleaning, apply a quality grout sealer to protect against future staining.

### Regular Maintenance
Establish a routine cleaning schedule to prevent buildup before it becomes visible.

### Improved Ventilation
Ensure your bathroom has adequate ventilation to reduce humidity levels that promote mold growth.

- Regrouting existing tile
