# How Mapei Sports Flooring Enhances Durability and Safety in Sports Facilities?

Sports facilities demand flooring that performs under extreme conditions. From high-impact activities to constant foot traffic, sports floors must deliver durability, safety, and consistent performance. Mapei sports flooring solutions meet these demanding requirements while protecting athletes and extending facility life.
