# Anti-Slip Stair Nosing for Tiled Steps: A Small Upgrade for Big Safety Benefits

If you've ever felt uneasy walking down tiled stairs, you're not alone. Tiled steps, while stylish and durable, can be notoriously slippery—especially when wet. Stair nosing offers a simple, effective solution that combines safety with aesthetic appeal.

## Five Reasons to Invest in Stair Nosing

### 1. Safety Enhancement
Textured surfaces improve traction:
- Anti-slip materials reduce fall risk
- Better grip in wet conditions
- Consistent friction coefficient
- Reliable performance over time

### 2. Visual Distinction
Defined step edges improve visibility:
- Contrast helps identify stair edges
- Reduces missteps from poor visibility
- Aids those with vision difficulties
- Enhances safety in low light

### 3. Durability Protection
Nosing shields vulnerable tile edges:
- Buffers against chipping and cracking
- Takes impact instead of tiles
- Extends installation lifespan
- Reduces maintenance costs

### 4. Aesthetic Options
Modern nosing enhances design:
- Multiple material choices
- Various finish options
- Color coordination possibilities
- Architectural integration

### 5. Regulatory Compliance
Commercial spaces often require:
- Building code compliance
- Accessibility standards
- Occupational safety requirements
- Liability mitigation

## Material Options

### Aluminum
Ideal for high-traffic areas:
- Exceptional durability
- Lightweight installation

### Glow-in-the-Dark
Low-light visibility:
- Emergency illumination
- Power outage safety
- Continuous visibility
- Modern technology

## Installation Guide

### Step 1: Measurement
Measure each stair accurately:
- Tread width
- Nosing projection needs
- Multiple stair variations
- Material quantities

### Step 2: Cutting
Prepare nosing sections:
- Precision cuts for fit
- Proper tools for material type
- Clean, square edges
- Account for overlaps

### Step 3: Surface Cleaning
Prepare adhesion surfaces:
- Remove dust and debris
- Clean oils and residues
- Allow complete drying
