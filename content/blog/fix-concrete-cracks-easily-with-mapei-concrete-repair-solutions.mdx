# Top Mapei Concrete Repair Products for Fixing Cracks in Concrete Surfaces

Concrete is one of the most durable and widely used building materials, but over time, cracks inevitably form due to structural stress, environmental exposure, shrinkage, or external loads. Understanding crack types and selecting appropriate repair products ensures lasting results.

## Understanding Crack Types

### Hairline Cracks
Fine fractures under 1/16 inch wide, typically caused by shrinkage during curing. While often cosmetic, they can allow moisture penetration.

### Surface Cracks
Shallow damage from weather impacts, abrasion, or surface stress. These affect appearance and can deepen over time if untreated.

### Structural Cracks
Deeper cracks indicating serious structural issues. These require professional assessment and often reinforcement in addition to filling.

### Settlement Cracks
Resulting from soil movement or inadequate foundation support. These may be active (continuing to grow) or dormant.

### Deep Cracks
Extending well into the concrete mass, these require specialized injection techniques for complete filling.

### Expansion Cracks
Caused by thermal expansion and contraction cycles. Proper repair must accommodate ongoing movement.
